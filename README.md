#### Project Status: Complete.


# Project Title: Cambridge-Driving Dataset Image Segmentation using DeepLabsV3 Model with Resnet50 Backbone.
## Project Description.
This Image segmentation project is served as an introduction to image segmentation using DeepLabsV3 through PyTorch for me. It was used to prepare for a much advanced project that can be found (here)[https://github.com/]  

The model trained achieved a Dice score of `0.9515` after just 35 epochs. There were no subsequent post-processing steps involved in this rproject.

### Tools and Libraries used:
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* PIL
* matplotlib

## Snapshots of Predictions made by model.
